My submission to a [Gynvael's Winter GameDev Challenge 2017](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=668). The challenge was to make a turn-based strategy game that fit in 20KB and ran on the latest version of Chrome. No other browsers are guaranteed to be supported.

Play online: **(Only guaranteed to work in latest version of Chrome)** https://ajaxgb.github.io/forg20k/

- Left click to select FORGS.
- A FORG's moves are listed at the bottom, along with HP and MP.
- Click on moves or scroll between them with the mousewheel.

- Targets will display the number of MP they cost.
- Right click on a valid target to perform the selected move.
- MP is regained at the beginning of each turn.
- Eat BUGGS to regain health.

Note that the HTML file cannot be run as a file:// URL or it will not work.
It must be hosted on a server.
